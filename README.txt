# MSc Summer Project â€“ Evolutionary Weapon System for 2D Rogue-like Shooter

This repository contains the source files for an MSc summer project focused on developing a real-time, AI-driven weapon evolution system in a 2D rogue-like shooter game built using Unity.

## Project Overview

The game explores how machine learning algorithms can dynamically optimize weapon behaviors based on gameplay conditions and player interactions. The goal is to create emergent weapon synergies that evolve in real time, increasing replayability and strategic depth.

## How to Run the Project

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   - Ensure you download the entire repository including the `Assets/` and `ProjectSettings/` folders.

2. **Install Unity Hub**
   - Download and install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download).

3. **Open the Project in Unity**
   - Launch Unity Hub.
   - Use the **Open Project** option to select the downloaded project folder.
   - Make sure to open it with the correct Unity Editor version:  
     ðŸ”§ **Unity Editor Version:** `2022.3.x LTS` *(Replace with your exact version, e.g., 2022.3.12f1)*

4. **Required Project Settings**
   - Target platform: `PC, Mac & Linux Standalone`
   - Scripting backend: `IL2CPP` or `Mono` *(depending on your preference)*
   - API Compatibility Level: `.NET Standard 2.1`
   - Rendering Pipeline: `Built-in` (unless you're using URP or HDRP)

5. **Let Unity Generate Dependencies**
   - When the project opens, Unity will automatically generate the `Library/`, `Temp/`, and other necessary folders.
   - Wait for the initial asset import to complete.

6. **Play the Game**
   - Open the main scene (e.g., `Assets/Scenes/Main.unity`).
   - Click the **Play** button in the Unity Editor to start the game.
